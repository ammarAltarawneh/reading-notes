# The Command Line
1- A command line or terminal is a text-based interface where you enter commands. To open it, search for "Terminal" on Windows. The terminal runs a shell  that executes commands. It provides shortcuts and prevents mistakes.

2- Basic Navigation covers the basics of navigating the Linux system. 

The "pwd" command displays the current working directory, 

the "ls" command lists the contents of a directory. 

There are two types of paths: absolute and relative. Absolute paths start from the root directory ("/"), while relative paths are based on the current location in the system and do not begin with a slash.

3- Everything is considered as a file, and uses the "file" command to determine file types. Linux is case-sensitive, allowing files with similar names but in different cases.

4- The Linux manual pages provide detailed information about commands, including their functionality and options. 

"man" command followed by a specific command allows you to access its manual page. 

The "man -k" command performs a keyword search across all manual pages

the "/" command searches within a specific manual page. 

The "n" command navigates to the next found item during a search within a manual page.

5- "mkdir" is used to create directories.

"rmdir" is used to remove directories.

"touch" creates blank files.

"cp" copies files or directories.

"mv" moves or renames files or directories.

"rm" deletes files.
