# File and Stream I/O
 File and Stream I/O in C# and .NET involves reading/writing files and streams. System.IO provides classes for file operations, while streams handle byte-level data. 
 
 Reader and writer classes convert characters to/from bytes. Asynchronous I/O improves responsiveness. Compression classes handle file compression. Exception handling is important.
