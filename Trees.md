# Trees

1. Binary Trees:

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
In C#, a binary tree can be implemented using a custom class defining the node structure, with left and right pointers to the child nodes.
Common operations on binary trees include insertion, deletion, traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order), and searching for a particular element.

2. Binary Search Trees (BST):

A binary search tree is a type of binary tree with the following property: for every node with value 'X', all nodes in its left subtree have values less than 'X', and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than 'X'.
In C#, a BST can be implemented using the binary tree class, adding methods to maintain the BST property during insertions and deletions.
The BST property ensures efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements, making it an essential data structure for ordered data.

3. K-ary Trees:

A K-ary tree is a generalization of the binary tree, where each node can have up to 'K' children, instead of just two.
In C#, a K-ary tree can be implemented using a custom node class with an array or a list to store the references to its child nodes.
K-ary trees are useful in scenarios where a node can have multiple branches or when more than two choices are available at each step.
