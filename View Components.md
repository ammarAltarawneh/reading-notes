# View Components
View Components are an integral part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern used in web development. They provide a way to encapsulate reusable, self-contained chunks of UI logic and content that can be easily integrated into various parts of a web application's views. This set of reading notes explores the key concepts, benefits, and best practices associated with View Components in MVC.
### Key Characteristics of View Components:

Self-contained: View Components encapsulate both the HTML markup and the associated logic, making them self-contained and easy to manage.

Independent: They can have their models, actions, and views, making them independent and modular.

Rendered as Tags: View Components are typically rendered as HTML tags within Razor views, which enhances their reusability.

Separation of Concerns: They help in maintaining a clear separation of concerns, as UI logic is isolated from the main view or controller.

### Benefits of View Components:

Reusability: View Components promote code reuse, as you can use the same component across multiple views or even in different projects.

Isolation: They allow you to isolate complex UI logic, promoting maintainability and testability.

Composability: View Components can be combined to create more complex UI structures, providing a building-block approach to web development.

Improved Readability: Separating complex UI logic into View Components can make your views cleaner and more readable.
### Creating and Using View Components:

Creation: View Components are typically created as classes that derive from ViewComponent and are placed in a designated folder, such as the "Components" folder.

Invoking View Components: They are invoked in Razor views using the @await Component.InvokeAsync("ComponentName") syntax.

Passing Data: View Components can receive parameters, making them flexible and customizable.
