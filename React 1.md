# React 
- React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Developed by Facebook, it is used for creating single-page applications and mobile applications.
- React uses a component-based architecture, making it easy to build reusable UI elements.

## React - Hello World
- A simple React application typically starts with rendering a "Hello, World!" message.
- React applications are composed of components, and the `ReactDOM.render()` function is used to render a component into the DOM.

## React - JSX
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to define the structure of components.
- JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements.

## React - Rendering Elements
- React elements are the smallest building blocks of a React application.
- ReactDOM's `render()` function is used to render React elements into the DOM.
- React elements are immutable, and updating the UI involves creating new elements and comparing them to the previous ones.

## React - Components & Props 
- React components are reusable UI elements that encapsulate their behavior and presentation.
- Components can accept data and configuration through props (short for properties).
- Props allow components to be configured dynamically, making them versatile and reusable.

## React - State & Lifecycle
- State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time within a component.
- Components can have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` for managing side effects.
- State changes trigger re-rendering of components, updating the UI.

## React - Handling Events
- React allows developers to define event handlers in a declarative manner.
- Event handlers are functions that respond to user interactions like clicks or input changes.
- React's synthetic event system ensures consistent event handling across different browsers.

# Reading Notes on Tailwind CSS

## Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies building responsive and customizable web interfaces.
- It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements.
- Tailwind promotes a modular and consistent approach to styling.

## Utility-First CSS
- Utility-first CSS is an approach where you create small, reusable utility classes for styling elements.
- These classes are combined to style components, resulting in a highly maintainable and efficient CSS codebase.
- Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework.

## Tailwind in 15 Minutes
- Learning the basics of Tailwind CSS can be quick, and you can start using it effectively in just 15 minutes.
- Key concepts include applying utility classes to elements, responsive design with classes like `sm:`, and customization using configuration files.

# Reading Notes on Next.js

## Next.js
- Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building modern web applications.
- It is built on top of React and provides features like server-side rendering, routing, and code splitting out of the box.
- Next.js simplifies the development of production-ready React applications.

## Learn Next.js
- Learning Next.js involves understanding its core features, including server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- The framework provides a clear folder structure and conventions for building pages and API routes.
- Routing is handled automatically, and you can use data fetching methods like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` to fetch data for pages.

## Why to Use Next.js
- Next.js offers several advantages for web development:
  - SEO-friendly: SSR and SSG improve SEO by generating HTML on the server.
  - Faster load times: Code splitting and optimized builds lead to faster page loads.
  - Automatic routing: Simplifies navigation within the application.
  - Great developer experience: Offers useful features and a clear project structure.
  - Scalability: Suitable for both small projects and large-scale applications.
