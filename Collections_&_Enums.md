# Collections & Enums

Collections in C# are used for managing groups of related data efficiently.

Lists are dynamic collections that can grow or shrink, while arrays have a fixed size.

Dictionaries provide key-value pairs for efficient lookup.

Queues follow the FIFO principle, and stacks adhere to the LIFO principle.

Enums are used to define named constant values.

Enum values have an underlying integral type and can be accessed using their names.

Enums support various operations such as iteration, checking existence, and conversion.

Flags enums enable combining multiple values using bitwise operations.
