# LINQ & Delegates

* Delegates are references to methods, allowing for method passing and event handling in C#.

* LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful querying and manipulation feature in C# for various data sources.

* LINQ provides a uniform query syntax and supports both query comprehension and method syntax.

* Basic LINQ query operations include filtering, projection, ordering, grouping, and aggregation.

* LINQ and delegates improve code readability, maintainability, and code reuse.

* They are essential components in modern C# development and widely used in frameworks and libraries.
