# Entity Framework and APIs

**Entity Framework:**

Entity Framework (EF) is a Microsoft ORM framework for working with relational databases using .NET objects.

It eliminates the need for manual SQL queries and simplifies data access code.

EF is a class that maps to data base table where each property maps to a column.

EF Core is the lightweight version for .NET Core.

**APIs:**

APIs are sets of rules allowing software applications to communicate with each other.

They enable accessing functionalities of other apps or services without knowing implementation details.

Web APIs (RESTful APIs) use HTTP methods and data formats like JSON or XML for communication.

APIs are documented and used for various purposes like service integration or building microservices.
