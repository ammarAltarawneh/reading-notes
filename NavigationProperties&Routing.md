## Navigation Properties in .NET:

Navigation Properties facilitate relationships between entities in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems like Entity Framework. They enable easy navigation and access to related entities within the data model, streamlining code and improving maintainability.

## Routing in .NET MVC and Core:

Routing in .NET MVC and .NET Core involves mapping incoming requests to appropriate controllers and actions. In .NET MVC, routing is configured in the RouteConfig class, while in .NET Core, it is done in the Startup.cs file. Both frameworks use URL patterns to determine how requests are processed, with .NET Core offering additional flexibility and compatibility with API-based applications.
