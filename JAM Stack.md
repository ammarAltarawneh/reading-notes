# JAM Stack
### Introduction:
- JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) is a web development approach focused on decoupling the front-end from the back-end for better performance and security.

### JAMstack Technologies:
- Utilize Static Site Generators (SSGs) alongside .NET for pre-rendered content.
- Serverless functions like Azure Functions and AWS Lambda can power back-end functionality.
- Headless CMS solutions provide content sources for .NET-based JAMstack sites.

### Benefits of JAMstack:
- Improved performance due to pre-rendering and CDNs.
- Enhanced security by reducing server-side vulnerabilities.
- Scalability with serverless functions and CDNs.

### Challenges and Considerations:
- Learning curve for developers new to JAMstack.
- Authentication and authorization can be more complex.

### Tools and Resources:
- Frameworks like Blazor and .NET Core.
- Hosting and deployment platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, or Azure Static Web Apps.
- Online tutorials and documentation for learning JAMstack in .NET.
